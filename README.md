## ✨ Features

CF Mentor enhances your Codeforces experience with:

* ⏱ **Stopwatch & Session Tracking** Time your problem-solving sessions, pause/resume anytime, and track how long you spend on each problem.
* ⭐ **Bookmarks & Custom Difficulty Ratings** Save problems for later and assign difficulty ratings that fit your training style.
* 📊 **Two Rating Modes** Choose between **Codeforces original rating** or **Clist rating** for problem difficulty display.
* 📝 **In-Page Notes** Write and save notes directly on problem pages — ideas, solutions, or reminders are always right where you need them.
* 🔍 **Advanced Problem Filtering** Search by tags, difficulty range, solved status, problem index, and even combine tags with AND/OR logic.
* 📅 **Before Contest Reminder** A small heads-up before upcoming Codeforces contests so you never miss them.

## 🔧 Feature Toggles

You can enable/disable individual features from the extension popup. These settings are saved to Chrome's local storage and persist across browser restarts.

Toggles available:
- Problem Assistant: Sidebar on problem pages with bookmark, notes and optional stopwatch.
- Stopwatch: Show/hide the stopwatch row inside Problem Assistant.
- Advanced Filtering: Replace the default tag filter on the Problemset page with an advanced filter panel.
- Enhanced Data Table: Replace the Problemset table with a richer data table.
- Chat Panel (experimental): Mount a chat panel overlay.

Changes take effect immediately on open tabs; the extension listens for updates and mounts/unmounts features live.
